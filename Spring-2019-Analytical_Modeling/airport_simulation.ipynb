This environment contains 3 functions, one to initialize the environment, one to check passengers through the boarding-pass checker process, and one to put passengers through the scan process. An airport has a limited number of boarding-pass checkers (num_checkers) to check passengers in parellel as well as a limited number of passenger scanners (num_scanners). Passengers have to queue at one boarding pass checker. When they got one, they can start the boarding pass check process and wait for it to finish which takes 0.75 minutes (check_time). They then move on to the queue at one scanner. When they get a scanner, they can start the scan process and wait for it to finish which takes between 0.5 and 1.0 minutes (scan_time)."

The minimum number of checkers and scanners required for a low volume airport is 4, and the minimum required checkers and scanners for a high volume airport is 37. To improve upon this analysis, something that would be interesting to explore is the individual number of checkers versus scanners, instead of iterating through them at the same rate. We might find that either the checkers or the scanners might have a large impact on the wait time. This information would be most useful if we knew the max available of each of these categories, as well as the total cost of each to determine which value to minimize."
